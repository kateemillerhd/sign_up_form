# Sign-Up Form

This project is a sign-up form for an imaginary service, created as part of The Odin Project
curriculum. It demonstrates the use of semantic HTML, modern CSS, form validation, and layout
structuring based on a design reference.

## Project Goals

- Practice creating structured, semantic HTML
- Apply CSS styling and layout techniques
- Implement basic HTML form validation using `pattern`, `required`, and pseudo-classes like `:focus`
  and `:invalid`
- Match a reference design

## Features

- Large background image with a semi-transparent overlay behind the logo
- External custom font
- Two-column layout with an image sidebar
- Styled form inputs with:
    - Light borders by default
    - Blue border and shadow on focus
    - Red border when password validation fails
- Submit button styled to match the tones from the background image

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (no framework or preprocessors)
- Git & GitHub for version control


## Notes

- The form uses built-in HTML validation (no JavaScript)
- Passwords must include at least one number, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and
  be atleast 8 characters long
- Matching password validation is **not implemented**
- The site is **not responsive**
